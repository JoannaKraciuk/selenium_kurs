# ðŸ“–selenium_kurs

### This repository was entirely created during the Selenium Python from scratch course. 
During the course, I gained knowledge on:
* creating automated tests using the Python programming language
* knowledge of basic and more advanced techniques of creating tests in Selenium
* basics of the Python programming language
* creating automated tests and razports of web application tests using:
#### -  PyTest
####  - Page Object Model
#### -  Allure

The next step will be to develop it by adding new tests and reports.
